# @ryyppy/antwar-default

This is an opinionated antwar boilerplate.

Some highlights on the configuration:
- Manual route mapping (no directory / filename magic)
- SASS
- CSS-Modules
- PostCSS
- Reason & ReasonReact
- MDX
- Webpack
- HtmlWebpackPlugin
- Netlify setup script

## How to use

```
# Build Reason sources
npm run bs:build

# Start dev server
npm start

# Build the website
npm run build

# Run BuckleScript in watch mode
npm run bs:watch

```
